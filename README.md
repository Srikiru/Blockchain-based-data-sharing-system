# Blockchain-Based Data Sharing System

## Overview
Our Blockchain-Based Data Sharing System is designed to ensure secure, decentralized, and transparent sharing of sensitive data across multiple participants. By leveraging blockchain's inherent properties, we aim to eliminate traditional inefficiencies in data sharing while maintaining confidentiality and trust among users.

This system is particularly suited for organizations requiring secure data collaboration without relying on centralized authorities. 

## Key Features
- **Decentralized Ledger**: The system uses blockchain to store and track all data-sharing transactions, ensuring immutability and transparency.
- **Smart Contracts**: Automates data-sharing agreements, ensuring that predefined conditions are met before data is exchanged.
- **Data Encryption**: All shared data is encrypted to protect confidentiality, ensuring only authorized parties can access the data.
- **Permissioned Access**: Ensures that only authorized users can participate in the network, offering enhanced privacy and security.
- **Auditability**: Every transaction is logged immutably, providing a complete audit trail for compliance purposes.
- **Interoperability**: Designed to be flexible, the system supports integration with existing data management and IT infrastructures.

## Architecture
Our solution uses a hybrid blockchain model that combines the security and transparency of public blockchains with the scalability and performance of private blockchains.

1. **Public Blockchain Layer**: Provides trust and immutability by recording data-sharing events across a decentralized network.
2. **Private Blockchain Layer**: Handles data processing and transaction throughput to support enterprise-level performance requirements.
3. **Smart Contract Layer**: Manages all business logic, governing who can access data and under what conditions.

## Use Cases
- **Healthcare**: Securely share medical records between hospitals and clinics while maintaining patient privacy.
- **Supply Chain**: Provide real-time visibility and traceability across supply chain partners.
- **Financial Institutions**: Facilitate the secure exchange of financial data between banks while complying with regulatory requirements.
- **Research and Education**: Universities and researchers can safely share datasets while maintaining ownership and control over their intellectual property.

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run our blockchain-based data-sharing system.

### Prerequisites
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), and [Hyperledger Fabric](https://www.hyperledger.org/use/fabric).
- Ensure you have access to a blockchain network (e.g., Ethereum, Hyperledger, etc.).

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/blockchain-data-sharing.git
   cd blockchain-data-sharing
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up the blockchain network**:
   Use the provided Docker configurations to start a blockchain network instance.
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

4. **Deploy Smart Contracts**:
   Deploy the necessary smart contracts that will govern the data-sharing agreements.

5. **Start the Application**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage
Once the system is up and running, users can register, upload their data securely, and define the terms for sharing it via smart contracts. Data recipients can request access by meeting the conditions defined in the smart contract.
